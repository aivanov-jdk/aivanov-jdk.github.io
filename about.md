Hey! My name is *Alexey Ivanov*, or *Aleksei* in its current transliteration,
which corresponds to *Алексей Иванов* in Cyrillic.
I prefer the former spelling, *Alexey*,
or even its shortened form *Alex*.

I am a Java client sustaining engineer at Oracle. I work on fixing bugs in
client libraries&nbsp;— <abbr title="Abstract Window Toolkit">AWT</abbr>,
Swing, Java&nbsp;2D&nbsp;— in the JDK project and in JDK update releases.

My OpenJDK id is [`aivanov`](https://openjdk.org/census#aivanov).
I am a reviewer for the JDK project and a member of the
Client Libraries Group in OpenJDK.
